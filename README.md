This is a tutorial on Codecademy that clones the Etsy website using Ruby on Rails.

Fix files in app/views/shared -- I need to create a _footer.html.erb file to complement the _topnav.html.erb file.

Add links. There are links in the products and categories pages, but there should be links back to the homepage and from the homepage to other pages to make navigating the site easier.

File duplicates are on Google Drive under 'etsy-app'.
